So, [GitHub](https://github.com) uses README.md to make long descs about your repos. and i found out *Neocities accepts .md for free websites*, which is cool!

This is just a test by the way, nothing personal. and i can also `display code!` which is a HUGE step in tutorial stuff.

So, if I make github tutorials, it will use .md and you can't stop me.

**AND IT ACCEPTS HTML!!!! HUH?? maybe some idk BUT MAYBE JS AND DEF CSS!!!!!!!!**
