# underwhite's repo 🐱📝
since I can't update in school hours due to neocities being blocked, i've decided to make a repo for my site!
> i had to manually add all my folders because the git bash program is refusing :(
## understanding:
- ⭐ The `public` folder is where the source code for my site belongs, where all the neocities stuff goes to deploy to, and the `workplace` folder helps me sync all my changes, using a .yml file and my neocities API (which is stored hiddenly). <br /><br />
- 📜 I used the [git tutorial](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/git-tutorial) from petrapixel's website (not including adding all my pages to the site manually) and [deploy-to-neocities](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities/) to sync all my changes!




have a wonderful day, and a happy time! 💮🎂
