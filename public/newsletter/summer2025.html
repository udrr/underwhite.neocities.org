    <p>* It's gonna take a while for the new <strong>GUESTBOOK</strong> to release, just so you know. It's almost there, just some moblie issues and all that.</p>
    <p>* (yes, this letter IS moblie friendly.)</p>
    <p>* ...</p>
    <p>* Lets just see what we have now..</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>* Not that much, but if you look at the javascript, it's pretty messy! I also am gonna add the guestbook as an Iframe.</p>
    <h2>OTHER STUFF I'M WORKING ON</h2>
    
    <p>* Way too many projects, as this newsletter a project too. because it's gonna be monthly, maybe even twice a month, Who knows? I may miss a few months but eh that's ok.</p>
    <p>* Speaking of, I think my test blog disappeared! It's nowhere in the testing folder..</p>
    <p>* Wait, nevermind.. <a href="https://underwhite.neocities.org/testing/layout">I found it</a>. I'll also be making a blog too, cuz i have nothing to do these days then to doomscroll on my phone..</p>
    <p>* Anyways speaking of.. What should I do next? Guestbook, blog, webring, webcique.. Yeah there's nothing. <a href="https://underwhite.straw.page">Even the drawing board is crossed off</a>!</p>
    <p>* So, you can tell <a href="//neocities.org/site/underwhite">ME</a> what I should do next.. because I'm bored. Anyways rant over. </p>
    
    <h2>MY WEATHER</h2>
    <p>* Oh yeah, the weather.. It's summer so we are slowly evaporating away from the heat, yes it's 41 celsius outside, i'm not joking. Probably because I live in the hottest country with the tallest buildings..</p>
    <p>* Also, I'm glad I have an AC or I would be sweating.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>* Anyways, newsletter over.. See you next month.. like 8 days later.</p>
